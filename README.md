## New Generation NodeJS with Babel 7 and Webpack 4

### description

Are you bored of using the old and not COOL

```js
const express = require("express");
```

or even worse

```js
var express = require("express");
```

hell no! Come join us to the new era of JavaScript with `create-server-app`

### Plug and Play

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/EnetoJara/create-server-app.git
```

Once it is downloaded, first thing you need to do is to get into the folder:

```bash
$ cd create-server-app
```

then remove my git "PLEASE".

```bash
$ rm -rf ./.git
```

How about if now we add our own git

```bash
$ git init
```

Now lets install the dependencies.

```bash
$ npm ci
```

yes you saw right `npm ci` the "c" tells npm to look for the exact versions on the package-lock.json

now lets test it

```bash
$ npm start
```

it will start the dev server
